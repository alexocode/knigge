# Contributing

If you discover issues, have ideas for improvements or new features,
please [open an issue](https://github.com/sascha-wolf/knigge/issues)
or submit a pull request.

Make sure to follow the following guidelines when doing so.

## Issue Reporting

* Check that the issue has not already been reported.
* Check that the issue has not already been fixed in the latest changes
  (a.k.a. `main`).
* Be clear, concise and precise in your description of the problem.
* Open an issue with a descriptive title and a summary in grammatically correct,
  complete sentences.

## Pull Requests

* Read [how to properly contribute to open source projects on GitHub](https://www.gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request).
* Fork the project.
* Use a topic/feature branch so you're able to make additional changes later, if necessary.
* Write [good commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
* Use the same coding conventions as the rest of the project.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. So we can avoid that it breaks accidentally in the future.
* Add an entry to the [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) accordingly. See [changelog entry format](#changelog-entry-format).
* Open a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests) that relates to *only* one subject with a clear title
  and description in grammatically correct, complete sentences.
